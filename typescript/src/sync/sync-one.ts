/**
 * syncOneWorkout — the Hevy→Garmin upload engine, host-agnostic.
 *
 * DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT. Because a bad upload creates a duplicate Garmin/Strava
 * activity — a hard user constraint — the default is dryRun=true and NO Garmin
 * write and NO store mutation happen unless the caller passes { dryRun: false }.
 *
 * The three-layer never-duplicate contract:
 *
 *   Layer 1 — already resolved: a terminal `synced_workouts` row exists for
 *     the workout → SKIPPED. The pure dedup excludes these when picking the
 *     next candidate; this module re-checks the picked workout against the live
 *     ledger so a concurrent sync can't slip a just-synced id through.
 *
 *   Layer 2 — Garmin already has it: BEFORE uploading, the gateway asks Garmin
 *     whether an activity already exists at the workout's start time. If one
 *     does, we DO NOT upload (409 prevention) — we match it and rename/describe
 *     the existing activity instead.
 *
 *   Layer 3 — in-flight ledger: claimPending atomically inserts a
 *     pending_uploads row. If another process already claimed the workout, our
 *     claim loses and we defer, so two workers never double-upload.
 *
 * ALL THREE gate the upload. In dryRun mode layers 1 and 2 run (reads only) to
 * compute the decision, but NO claim, NO upload, NO finalize, NO ledger write.
 *
 * All IO goes through `SyncDeps`: the store, a lazily built Garmin gateway, and
 * the Hevy fetch. The engine itself is pure orchestration.
